This simple React app is paired to a pokemon graphql 
API:
https://graphql-pokemon2.vercel.app/

It is querying pokemons and logging them in the console.

Instructions:
1. Display each pokemon as card. One card per row is fine.
In each card, display the pokemon's:
  - Name
  - Number
  - Image

Styling is not critical but the cards should be easily
readable.

2. Sort pokemon alphabetically by name

3. Add a button to each card called "sort". When
pressed, the display should be shifted so that the selected
pokemon is now first in order. All elements should remain
in alphabetical order. For example:

A -> B -> C -> D -> E

if "C" is selected, the display will become:

C -> D -> E -> A -> B

Always be sure that whichever pokemon is selected will
be the first in order displayed, no matter how many 
times the list shifts.

BONUS (10 minutes):

1. List all evolutions of pokemon in their card
2. Display the name of each evolution as a button.
3. When the button is clicked, make that pokemon the 
first order displayed, keeping alphabetical order.

Example:

If "Bellsprout" has evolution pokemon of "Weepinbell"
and "Victreebel", if "Weepinbell" is clicked, "Weepinbell"
will become the first pokemon displayed
in sorted order.
